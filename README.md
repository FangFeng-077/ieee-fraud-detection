# ieee-fraud-detection


Recently, there are lots of scandal about academic fraud both in China and the U.S. Those scandal not only poisoning the academia but losing public faith about academic integrity. Eliminating people's respect for knowledge and education which will last even affect our next generation.

This project proposes a new method and model to identify the misbehavior in academia which could effectively help to build up integrity environment for research and host the fair for those hard working research fellows.

The long term benefit for commercialization:
If this method and model goes well, then it is possible to commercialize and has huge economic potential. It could work for detecting the paper which is going to publish or for graduation thesis. The model could come up with a specific integrity level for each paper uploaded and set up a standard for passing or not. 

This business mode could benefit from charging membership or charging for the number of paper detected. Further more, when the business scaled, it could cooperate with several big publish organizations or academic institutes founding up a huge academic data base which beneficial pattern could be preformed and with lots of successful example in China.

And for another aspect, this model will not only benefit for academia, but as reference value for detecting fraud advertisement in online shopping platform. The situation keep happening is the users often reporting the product description does not matched with the real stuff. And the e-trade company have huge economic loss from customers' returning the goods and getting bad reputations about it. With this method of fraud detecting, it could based on the product description partly customer's feed back access the repeating commons' worlds and descriptive worlds. And come up with the result of the reliability of those products. And it could be really useful for customers and companies, remaining a fair competition about e-commerce.
