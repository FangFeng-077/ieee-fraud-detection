The project aims to predict consumer's  fraudulent transaction to stop millions of users financial loss. As a graduate student majors in risk assessment and control, I have great experience handling large dataset and observe abnormal transactions or behaviors, which benchmark machine learning models, NLP in the data science system.  

All around the world, the fraud transactions keep happening that customers report the product description does not matched with the real stuff. And the e-trade company have huge economic loss from customers' returning the goods and getting bad reputations about it. With this method of fraud detecting, it could based on the product description partly customer's feed back access the repeating commons' worlds and descriptive worlds. And come up with the result of the reliability of those products. And it could be really useful for customers and companies, remaining a fair competition about e-commerce.
